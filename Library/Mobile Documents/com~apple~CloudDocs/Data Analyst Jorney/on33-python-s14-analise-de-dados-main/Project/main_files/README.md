# 📊 Olist Data Analysis Project

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes data from the Olist e-commerce platform to uncover insights into customer behavior, seller performance, and product trends.

## ✨ General Insights
- The dataset includes a variety of product categories, seller locations, and customer reviews.
- **São Paulo** dominates both in sales and cancellations, indicating its central role in Brazil's e-commerce landscape.
- The majority of customers leave **positive reviews**, with **5-star ratings** being the most common.
- Some product categories, like **electronics and appliances**, are consistently among the best-selling and most-reviewed.
- **Smaller regions** tend to have lower ratings, possibly due to fewer transactions leading to greater visibility of negative experiences.

## 💡 Key Findings

### 1️⃣ Where are the highest review counts and ratings?
- The highest rating count is **5 stars**, with **63,525 reviews**.
- This suggests that customers are more likely to leave reviews when they are satisfied with their purchase, or that overall store satisfaction is high.

### 2️⃣ Which state/region/city in Brazil has the most cancellations or incomplete shipments?
- The state with the most cancellations is **São Paulo**.
- This is likely because São Paulo has the highest number of sales transactions.

### 3️⃣ Which sellers have the highest and lowest reviews?
- **São Paulo** has the best-rated sellers.
- **Espírito Santo** has the worst-rated sellers, but this could be due to a lower volume of transactions compared to São Paulo.

### 4️⃣ Which products have the lowest reviews?
- The worst-rated product categories are:
  - **Bedding, tableware, and bath**
  - **Home appliances and electronics**

### 5️⃣ What are the three best-selling product types?

  1. **Electronics and appliances**
  2. **Bedding, tableware, and bath**
